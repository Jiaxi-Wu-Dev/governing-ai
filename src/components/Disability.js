            <p> Now that technology is getting more and more intertwined with our lives, we need to make sure that it is not leaving people behind. </p>
            <p> Society as a whole must find ways to integrate everyone as more people start to depend on technology and not try to exclude them just because its easier.</p>
            <p> The American Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed for that reason, to write into law and force companies to comply with the new standards.</p>
            <p> While certain companies followed the laws like Apple, companies like Netflix took a lawsuit by the National Association for the Dead to force subtitles onto the platform.</p>
            <p> Examples like these should highlight the need to keep everyone in mind as technology moves forward.</p>
